# Longer summary:

In Hong Kong, some shareholdings in locally-listed companies must be disclosed. (The full gory details are in [Part XV of the Securities and Futures Ordinance](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap571!en@2017-02-13T00:00:00?xpid=ID_1438403471151_001)). These can be long, short, or lending pool interests. [Here is example of a disclosure by a director of a listed company](http://sdinotice.hkex.com.hk/di/NSForm3a.aspx?fn=11000), published by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Amongst other details, it basically shows that Leng Chan Quek (郭令燦 in Chinese) took a 68.49% long position in the company Guoco Group Ltd., which has stock code 00053.

What if you want to know if Mr. Quek is _changing_ his position in Guoco Group Ltd. over time? The only way to find out until now was to painstakingly gather each relevant disclosure, and then perhaps copy and paste the raw numbers into Excel to calculate it.

And what if you want to know across the whole of the Hong Kong stock market which directors, individuals and corporations are changing their positions the most? How are you going to gather _every_ shareholding disclosure, and then aggregate them so you can easily see the biggest position changes over the last week, or month, or year?

Now you can just use [https://hkdata.dataguru.hk/hkex](https://hkdata.dataguru.hk/hkex/). Just choose long, short or lending pool positions; individual, corporate, or director shareholders; the minimum change you are interested in; and the date range. Then on the right will appear a table of all changes in positions that you requested. That's it. It looks something like this: (The stock codes link to the appropriate aastocks.com page)
