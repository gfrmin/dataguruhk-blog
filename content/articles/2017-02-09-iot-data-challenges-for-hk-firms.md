Summary: I spill some thought nuggets about IoT data challenges for Hong Kong businesses
---

In ComputerWorld magazine last week, I and a couple of other HK-based "thought leaders" gave our opinions about 'IoT data overload' and how Hong Kong firms can cope, or not. I come across a bit harshly, but I can't hide the fact that it's dangerous for businesses to focus on the buzzword tech instead of their fundamental business, which leads to wasted money and wasted opportunities. Of course they should be keeping up with the technology, but only if it makes sense for their business, and only if they've done everything else with a higher ROI first (e.g. having non-insanely-bad web, mobile and social media platforms). Also, as I said but is only obliquely mentioned in the CW article, data is not just a function, but rather an attitude or culture, or at least should be: as Carl Anderson said in one of my favourite recent books that every executive or founder needs on their shelf if they're at all serious about data, [Creating a Data-Driven Organization](http://amzn.to/2kKc6gC),

> Analytics is not data-driven if its findings are never seriously considered or acted upon. If they are unread, ignored, and the boss is going to do whatever he or she wants to do, regardless of what the data says, then they are ineffectual. To be data-driven, an organization must have the right processes and the right culture in place to augment or drive critical business decisions with these analyses and therefore have a direct impact on the business.

> Culture, then, is the key.
