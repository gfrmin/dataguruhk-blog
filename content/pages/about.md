Hi, my name is Guy Freeman. I have a PhD in Statistics from the University of Warwick in England, and have worked in both academia and business with different official titles each time, but basically I was a Data Guru: a data scientist who is zealous about using data science to solve problems.

I am also the founder and maintainer of [accessinfo.hk](https://accessinfo.hk), a Freedom of Information portal for Hong Kong.

Please get in touch at [guy@dataguru.hk](mailto:guy@dataguru.hk) or fill in the form below if 

* you have data you want to analyse, understand and/or visualise to make better decisions
* you want to collect, store and analyse data in a smarter way
* you want to learn R and/or other data analysis tools yourself
* you want a data strategy to help meet your goals
* you want a Frequentist vs Bayesian flame war :)
