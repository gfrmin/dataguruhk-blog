Guy Freeman has been a resident of Hong Kong for 6 years. After getting a PhD in Statistics from the University of Warwick in England, he worked in both academia (HKU) and business (DemystData, EY, Prudential) in Hong Kong with different official titles each time, but the common theme was that he used data to solve problems rigorously and efficiently.
