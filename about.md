My name is Guy Freeman. I have been in Hong Kong for over 3.5 years, working as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong and then as an Analytical Engineer at DemystData. Now I'm looking for new opportunities while working on my own projects, as well as consulting for local businesses with data needs and teaching statistics and "data science".

Please get in touch at [guy@dataguru.hk](mailto:guy@dataguru.hk) or fill in the form below if 

* you have data you need analysed
* you want to collect new data in a smart way
* you want to visualise or understand the data you have to make better decisions
* you want to learn R and/or other data analysis tools yourself
