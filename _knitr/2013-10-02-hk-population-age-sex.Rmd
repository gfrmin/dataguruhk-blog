UPDATE: Here's an animated version! I might reveal how I made it in the next post:

It's time to represent the beauty and mystery and energy of Hong Kong in graphs. You can tell I'm a statistician.

I'm planning to go through the compendium "<a href="http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/sp180.jsp?productCode=B1130303">Women and Men in Hong Kong: Key Statistics</a>" [check out the progressive ordering of sexes in the title!], a treasure trove of statistics about Hong Kong collected by the local <a href="http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/">Census and Statistics Department</a>. (This must have been set up after the reign of the erstwhile Financial Secretary "Sir" John James Cowperthwaite, who is said to have told Milton Friedman <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7696">"If I let them compute those statistics, they’ll want to use them for planning"</a>.) In the coming posts you'll see just how wonderful the trove is, but as a taster, I can tell you it includes the number of telex connections still active in Hong Kong. Brilliant. Unfortunately I can't find a more datatician-friendly version of the compendium, but part of the fun will be trying to extract the data from the PDF in one way or another.

First up comes the mid-year population by age and sex from 1981 to 2012, as displayed in Table 1.1 on page 8 of the Compendium (page 36 of the PDF because of introductory bumf). This misses the biggest immigration waves which increased the population of Hong Kong many-fold in the space of a couple of decades, but maybe I'll focus on that another time. <a href="http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_1149/T01_01_01A.xls">This data can be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet</a> (along with the population figures excluding those occasional non-people, "Foreign Domestic Helpers", otherwise known as maids, who are actually human <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1199312/hong-kongs-top-court-rejects-domestic-helpers-appeal-permanent?page=all">but too often</a> <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1312332/hong-kong-couple-jailed-torturing-indonesian-domestic-helper">not treated as such</a>).

Today's graph shows how the population is getting very old very quickly, and how the female to male ratio for those between 20 and 49 years of age is bulging, almost certainly because of those domestic helpers. If I may say so, it's even more beautiful than the bureaucrats' version on page 7/35, one of the few graphs they deign to include.
