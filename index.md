![Guy Freeman](/figs/thumb_gf.jpg)

I am Guy Freeman. I have a PhD in Statistics from the University of Warwick, and have worked in both academia and business with different official titles each time, but basically I was a Data Guru.

Now, while working on my own projects in Hong Kong, I'm looking for new opportunities to 

* consult for anyone with data needs
* teaching statistics and "data science"

So please get in touch at [guy@dataguru.hk](mailto:guy@dataguru.hk) or fill in the form below if 

* you have data you want to analyse, understand and/or visualise to make better decisions
* you want to collect and store new data in a smarter way
* you want to learn R and/or other data analysis tools yourself

I look forward to hearing from you.
