Hong Kong has recently experienced some of the most severe protests in decades, taking place under the moniker of "Umbrella Revolution/Movement". (That calling the protests a "revolution" is considered too extreme by some protesters is testament to the pragmatic and mild nature of most of the protesters). These protests include "occupation" of some public roads in Hong Kong, at Admiralty, Mong Kok and Causeway Bay.

One immediate trigger for the scale of these protests was the use by the local police of tear gas against peaceful protesters, [as can be seen in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO6okfun90k).

The police, previously holding a reputation as amongst the most professional in the world, lost more public trust [after some officers were allegedly caught on camera beating a protester on the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2aITGfN0qk).

Hong Kong is still governed by the Rule of Law, though, and there are procedures (in theory) for making complaints against police misbehaviour. These complaints are ultimately overseen by the [Independent Police Complaints Council](http://www.ipcc.gov.hk/index.html), and they publish [statistics about the complaints](http://www.ipcc.gov.hk/en/statistics_nature.html). With the professionalism of the police at stake, I wanted to see whether complaints were treated fairly.

Unfortunately the statistics at the above link are only for the years 2007 to 2009, and they are not granulated enough anyway (e.g. the don't show the results of complaints by type of complaint). Instead, one has to retrieve more recent statistics from the [annual reports](http://www.ipcc.gov.hk/en/reports_annual.html) available only in PDF format. But don't worry, I have parsed the figures out of the most recently published annual report for you... You can thank me later.

The data are for 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, and you can analyse them yourself [here]().
